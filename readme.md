# Clinic Booking System Database

### Project Title
**Clinic Booking System Database**

### Description
This project provides a simple, well-structured database design for a **Clinic Booking System**. It is built using MySQL and is designed to manage essential information for a medical clinic, including patient data, doctor details, and appointment scheduling.

The database schema is normalized to a basic level, which helps to minimize data redundancy and improve overall database efficiency. It includes tables for `patients`, `doctors`, `appointments`, and `specializations` with appropriate relationships and constraints to ensure data integrity.

### How to Run/Setup the Project
To set up this database, you will need a MySQL database server.

1.  **Open the SQL File:** Copy and paste the contents of the `clinic_booking_system.sql` file into a MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or the command-line).
2.  **Execute the Script:** Run the script. This will create a new database named `clinic_db`, build the necessary tables, and populate them with some example data.
3.  **Ready to Use:** The database will be ready to use immediately after the script completes its execution.
